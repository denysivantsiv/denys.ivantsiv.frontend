                <p>I took part in a 48-hour hackathon where my team and I built a travel-themed website. I handled the layout and styling, and we ended up winning the "Best UI/UX Design" award. It was intense, but so worth it!</p>

                <p>I was recently interviewed for a dev blog, where I talked about my journey into front-end and why it's important to take breaks and avoid burnout in this fast-paced industry.</p>

                <h2>Built a Full Website Without a Single Line of JavaScript</h2>
                <p>I recently challenged myself to build a complete, responsive website using only HTML and CSS - no JavaScript at all. The goal was to push the limits of what modern CSS can do. I used Flexbox, Grid, transitions, and even some CSS-only interactivity for the menu. It turned out cleaner and faster than I expected! This project reminded me how powerful well-written HTML and CSS can be. I'm planning to share the code and maybe write a short breakdown soon.</p>
